OSL: An Operational Semantics for Rust Language

OSL semantics is an operational semantics implemented by K-Framework,

which is a rewrite logic based formal modeling tool.

In order to run the semantics, K-framework should be installed.

The version that we suggest to install can be download at:

https://github.com/kframework/k/releases/tag/nightly-f5ea5c7

Other versions may arise some problems when compile and run OSL programs.

## Setup Ocaml

```sh
./k/bin/k-configure-opam
eval $(opam config env)
```
