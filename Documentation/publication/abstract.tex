	Ensuring memory safety is an essential issue in software security. Numerous memory safety vulnerabilities are correlated to memory access patterns.
	The ownership system is an efficient and effective mechanism for detecting unsafe memory risks implemented in many languages, such as Rust.
	In this paper,  we propose the framework OSL, which includes an intermediate language called \oslos~to capture the features of the ownership system, and a translator \oslt~to infer ownership properties in C programs by static analysis.
    The C programs translated by \oslt~can be executed  in \oslos~to detect  memory usage vulnerability.
	The ownership semantics is implemented in a formal modeling tool $\mathbb{K}$-Framework, which produces a language-independent formal ownership checker.
